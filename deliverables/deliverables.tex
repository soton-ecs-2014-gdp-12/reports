\subsection*{Walkthrough}

Each tab should be testing to see the working solution.

The tabs Single Question, Question Multiple, Question Stars, Question Text, Question Range all should show one demonstration of the specific question type.

The simple example should show a very basic example, this will be similar to Single Question.

The poll simple example should show an example 

Caesar Example is used to demonstrate a number of features being used. This has Videogular Cuepoints enabled so you will be able to see where the questions are shown.
