% ++ Points ++
%
% Video Player
%  - Several improvements made to Videogular (focuisng on accessibility)
%  - Compatibility with a range of devices was reviewed (problems with iOS)
%
% Videogular Questions
%  - The Definition File can be created manually or using the authoring tool
%  - The styling can be changed using CSS
%
% Authoring Tool
%  - Produces the Definition File
%  - Highly accessible
%  - The standalone nature of the plugins has allowed for there easy use in the
%  authoring tool
%  - The authoring tool allows previewing, making it easy to use
%
% Analytics
%  - Plugin allows the events to be sent over the network and recorded
%
% Testing
%  - Emphasis on integration tests and deliverable reports
%  - Example sites
%  - Unit testing for several repositories
%  - analytics front end as an integration test
%  - load testing
%
% Future work
%  - Primarily to aid integration with the future version of Synote
%  - Fixing the YouTube plugin
%  - Mobile devices need more testing, problems are not always solvable
%  - Second screening
%  - Angular 1 support is likely to continue, so this is not an issue. Also
%  Angular is not key to the project, as there are lots of components that could
%  be extracted and used without Angular
%  - Video accessibility (captions and colour)?

\section{Introduction}

\section{Project Management}

%Extensive review of related work and references; References relate both to academic and industrial work
%Excellent planning and progress, team worked independently, optimal use of teamâ€™s skills

%Justified evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the team, process, design, and results

\section{Framework Design}

%Clear evidence of original thinking, considerable knowledge and understanding and ability to face considerable challenge

During the initial stages of the project, considerable effort was spent on the
general approach. This did result in an approach that, while being quite
complicated, drawing on a large number of tools and technologies, provided
appropriate flexibility.

Using modern web technologies, e.g. the WebWorker (JavaScript sandbox) has
allowed us to use a programmatic definition file, rather than using exhaustive
data format.

During the course of the project, it was appropriate to separate the
functionality that were implemented in to several small modules, which were
then published.

Instantaneous feedback is key to learning, and this why this was built in as a
key feature to the Videogular Questions plugin.

\section{Final conclusions}

Creating videogular-questions and the associated tools in the framework has been a challenging project. It now allows users to go right from the creation
stage, to the publishing stage, through to the analytics stage. Having met all goals the team looks forward to the client using it within Synote, and hopefully seeing it used elsewhere online.

All the components have been published, and there are good signs that these are already being used.

%Very challenging project, met all goals, ready to be used
%Publishable/patentable approach, thoroughly tested, evidence of customer satisfaction
