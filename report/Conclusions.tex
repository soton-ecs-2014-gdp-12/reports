\section{Introduction}



\section{Project Management}

%Extensive review of related work and references; References relate both to academic and industrial work
%Excellent planning and progress, team worked independently, optimal use of teamâ€™s skills

%Justified evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the team, process, design, and results

\section{Framework Design}

%Clear evidence of original thinking, considerable knowledge and understanding and ability to face considerable challenge

During the initial stages of the project, considerable effort was spent on the
general approach. This did result in an approach that, while being quite
complicated, drawing on a large number of tools and technologies, provided
appropriate flexibility.

Using modern web technologies, e.g. the WebWorker (JavaScript sandbox) has
allowed us to use a programmatic definition file, rather than using exhaustive
data format.

During the course of the project, it was appropriate to separate the
functionality that were implemented in to several small modules, which were
then published.

Instantaneous feedback is key to learning, and this why this was built in as a
key feature to the Videogular Questions plugin.

\section{Final conclusions}

Creating videogular-questions and the associated tools in the framework has been a challenging project. Having met all goals the team looks forward to the client using it within Synote, and hopefully seeing it used elsewhere online. 
%Very challenging project, met all goals, ready to be used
%Publishable/patentable approach, thoroughly tested, evidence of customer satisfaction
