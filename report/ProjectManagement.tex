\chapter{Project Management} \label{Chapter: Project Management}
This project was run using a SCRUM project management approach. This involved weekly SCRUM meetings where the issues in the backlog were discussed. They were prioritised and given a point value which related to how much time and effort the issue would take to resolve. The highest priority issues were then assigned. Each person had a maximum capacity of points for each week.

To ensure that all work was backed up and available to the entire group a GitHub organisation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/soton-ecs-2014-gdp-12/}} was used. Separate repositories for each area of the project are located here for ease of access. Using GitHub made it easier to interact with other open source projects.

The group used \url{http://www.waffle.io} to manage the issues backlog as this would interface directly with GitHub.
