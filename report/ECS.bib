        abstract = {This paper discusses the development of a Web-based media annotation application named Synote, which addresses the important issue that while the whole of a multimedia resource on the Web can be easily bookmarked, searched, linked to and tagged, it is still difficult to search or associate notes or other resources with a certain part of a resource. Synote supports the creation of synchronized notes, bookmarks, tags, links, images and text captions. It is a freely available application that enables any user to make annotations in and search annotations to any fragment of a continuous multimedia resource in the most used browsers and operating systems. In the implementation, Synote categorized different media resources and synchronized them via time line. The presentation of synchronized resources makes full use of Web 2.0 AJAX technology to enrich interoperability for the user experience. Positive evaluation results about the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of Synote were returned when using it with students and teachers for a number of undergraduate courses.}

        abstract = {Current multimedia applications in Web 2.0 have generated large repositories for multimedia resources and annotations, so there is an urgent requirement to interlink annotations of these resources across different repositories to achieve better indexing and searching. To solve this problem, many researchers have been trying to apply semantic Web technologies to media fragments and annotations. Linked data has brought forward a promising way to expose, index and search media fragments and annotations which used to be isolated in different applications. This paper discusses in depth three key research problems when applying linked data principles in multimedia annotations: choosing URIs for media fragments, dereferencing media fragments and ontology alignment. An architecture is designed based on the possible solutions of the research problems. The key idea of the architecture is that it should act like an extra layer built on top of old applications when publishing linked data. A demo is built as an implementation of the architecture to show that media fragments can be published and linked to various datasets in the linked data cloud. In the future, some algorithms should be designed to make full use of the interlinked media fragments and annotations for indexing and searching. }

        abstract = {The cost of health and safety failures to UK industry is currently estimated at up to {\pounds}6.5 billion per annum with the construction sector suffering unacceptably high levels of work related incidents. Better health and safety education across all skill levels in the industry is seen as an integral part of any solution. Traditional lecture-based courses often fail to re-create the dynamic realities of managing health and safety (H\&S) on-site and therefore do not sufficiently create deeper cognitive learning (which results in remembering and using what was learned). The use of videos is a move forward, but passively observing a video is not cognitively engaging and challenging, and therefore learning is not as effective as it can be. This article describes the development of an interactive video in which learners take an active role. While observing the video, they are required to engage, participate, respond, and be actively involved. The potential for this approach to be used in conjunction with more traditional approaches to H\&S were explored using a group of second year undergraduate civil engineering students. The formative results suggested that the learning experience could be enhanced using interactive videos. Nevertheless, most of the learners believed that a blended approach would be most effective.}

        abstract = {Formative eAssessment can be very helpful in providing high quality higher education assignments. However, there are obstacles restricting the uptake of formative eAssessment in higher education including both cultural and technical issues. When a university is encouraging the uptake of formative eAssessment internally it is useful to have case studies from academic schools detailing how academics enthusiastic about formative eAssessment have used it in their modules. It is particularly helpful if these case studies document: i.) the principle obstacles that these champions had to deal with; ii.) a cooperative-design process through which these obstacles have been dealt with by the champions (with assistance from e.g. learning technologists); and iii.) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting formative eAssessments. However there is a shortage of such real-world long-term case studies. This paper helps fill this gap in the literature by describing the case of a Modern Languages module within a Russell Group university (Southampton). The formative eAssessment solution resulting from the case study utilises our QTI, mobile QTI, accessibility, and web 2.0 tools and can be positioned at the cutting edge of formative eAssessment practice. We have evaluated this with undergraduate student volunteers from Spanish modules and received positive feedback.}

In addition, care has been taken in the R2Q2 project to ensure that the solution produced will allow for future changes in the specification. The design of R2Q2 is described, the focus being on lessons learnt. We describe the architecture and the rationale of the internal Web services and explain the approach taken in implementing the QTI specification, showing how the design allows for future tags to be added with the minimal of programming effort. The QTI standard has not had a great take-up in part due to the lack of tools. In the 2006 JISC Capital, three Assessment projects were commissioned: item authoring, item banking, and QTI-compliant test delivery. This paper describes the ?ASDEL? test delivery engine, focusing upon its architecture, its relation to the item authoring and item banking services, and the integration of the R2Q2 Web service. }

Recent mobile devices provide a platform on which more complex applications can be implemented and therefore have the potential to be used as powerful learning tools, both offline and online. In this paper, we describe a mobile QTI rendering architecture and tools built on top of the core software library of ?ASDEL? to deliver an assessment consisting of an assembly of QTI items and to retrieve assessment results. A mobile QTI engine was deployed upon an Android system and provided services for rendering and processing QTI XML. It allowed learners to play QTI items natively and receive feedback effectively which enabled better support for offline mobile learning.}

It is our experience from numerous technology-supported education projects that QTI supports interoperability and exchange of assessments but completely neglects the authoring process of these assessments. In particular, the task of authoring of a large number of assessments for teachers without technical background is very time and resources consuming one. Therefore, we developed a novel format that focuses on supporting teachers in rapid authoring of huge number of E-Assessments and implemented it as a part of an educational Wiki system. In this paper we present this new format together with its implementation and the first evaluation results of the implemented tool. }

Almost a decade after the publication of the first version of QTI, even the interchange of simple multiple-choice tests between different systems remains problematic.  In this chapter, we present a critical analysis of QTI.  Our conclusion is that QTI has failed to provide interoperability of questions and tests due to serious problems in its design.}},
