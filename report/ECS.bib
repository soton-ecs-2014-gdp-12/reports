        abstract = {Current multimedia applications in Web 2.0 have generated large repositories for multimedia resources and annotations, so there is an urgent requirement to interlink annotations of these resources across different repositories to achieve better indexing and searching. To solve this problem, many researchers have been trying to apply semantic Web technologies to media fragments and annotations. Linked data has brought forward a promising way to expose, index and search media fragments and annotations which used to be isolated in different applications. This paper discusses in depth three key research problems when applying linked data principles in multimedia annotations: choosing URIs for media fragments, dereferencing media fragments and ontology alignment. An architecture is designed based on the possible solutions of the research problems. The key idea of the architecture is that it should act like an extra layer built on top of old applications when publishing linked data. A demo is built as an implementation of the architecture to show that media fragments can be published and linked to various datasets in the linked data cloud. In the future, some algorithms should be designed to make full use of the interlinked media fragments and annotations for indexing and searching. }

        abstract = {The cost of health and safety failures to UK industry is currently estimated at up to {\pounds}6.5 billion per annum with the construction sector suffering unacceptably high levels of work related incidents. Better health and safety education across all skill levels in the industry is seen as an integral part of any solution. Traditional lecture-based courses often fail to re-create the dynamic realities of managing health and safety (H\&S) on-site and therefore do not sufficiently create deeper cognitive learning (which results in remembering and using what was learned). The use of videos is a move forward, but passively observing a video is not cognitively engaging and challenging, and therefore learning is not as effective as it can be. This article describes the development of an interactive video in which learners take an active role. While observing the video, they are required to engage, participate, respond, and be actively involved. The potential for this approach to be used in conjunction with more traditional approaches to H\&S were explored using a group of second year undergraduate civil engineering students. The formative results suggested that the learning experience could be enhanced using interactive videos. Nevertheless, most of the learners believed that a blended approach would be most effective.}

        abstract = {The IMS Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) standard identifies sixteen different question types which may be used in on-line assessment. While some partial implementations exist, the R2Q2 project has developed a complete solution that renders and responds to all sixteen question types as specified. In addition, care has been taken in the R2Q2 project to ensure that the solution produced will allow for future changes in the specification. The design of R2Q2 is described, the focus being on lessons learnt. We describe the architecture and the rationale of the internal Web services and explain the approach taken in implementing the QTI specification, showing how the design allows for future tags to be added with the minimal of programming effort. The QTI standard has not had a great take-up in part due to the lack of tools. In the 2006 JISC Capital, three Assessment projects were commissioned: item authoring, item banking, and QTI-compliant test delivery. This paper describes the ?ASDEL? test delivery engine, focusing upon its architecture, its relation to the item authoring and item banking services, and the integration of the R2Q2 Web service. }

The tools developed operate with a web client, as a plug-in to Moodle, or as a desktop application. The paper also reports on the load testing of the internal services and concludes that these are best represented as components. The project first developed a Java library to implement the system.

The second version of the standard (QTIv2) works alongside other IMS standards, but take-up has been slow, with problematic implementations and no definitive reference software. The R2Q2 project aims to produce a set of loosely coupled web services that will provide definitive reference software for QTIv2. In this paper we describe how we have learnt from previous development efforts in order to produce a first architecture and initial implementation, we also describe the results of our interviews with the wider QTI community to identify what is believed to be important for our planned final reference implementation.}
