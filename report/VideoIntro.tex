Specific improvements to \gls{Videogular} were made up three main sections, accessibility, compatibility and scrub bar plugin creation. Each were conducted independently and the open source contributions accepted readily back into the main \gls{Videogular} project.

The main goals for this part of the project were to:
\begin{itemize}
\item investigate \gls{Videogular} to allow for its use within the new version of Synote
\item improve the accessibility of \gls{Videogular} to allow for its use by users with less than normal interface  devices
\item ensure that \gls{Videogular} was as compatible on as many devices as possible
\item add the ability to mark locations on the scrub bar
\item produce a plugin to allow the display of statistical data along the scrub bar
\end{itemize}
