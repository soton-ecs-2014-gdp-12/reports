\section{Design}

\subsection{Analytics emitted events}

The Videogular Analytics plugin emits a number of events which can be sent to a Web server for collection. The table below describes these events.

The plugin is designed so that events can easily be added by sending events to the `analytics' channel. These are automatically collected and prepared for sending to the given Web server.

\begin{tabular}{p{3.2cm} p{7cm} p{4cm}}

\textbf{Event name} & \textbf{Emitted when} & \textbf{Expected Payload} \\
\hline 
show\_question & a question is shown to the user & All of the associated question data \\
\hline 
end\_question & the annotation being shown has finished & None \\
\hline 
show\_results & there are results that will be shown & The results data being shown \\
\hline 
submitted\_question & the user submits a question & The chosen question response \\
\hline 
skipped\_question & the user skips a question & None \\
\hline 
continue\_question & a results page is closed by pressing the continue button & None \\
\hline 
play & the video starts to play & The time the video plays from \\
\hline 
pause & the video is paused & The time the video pauses at \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
