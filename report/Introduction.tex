\label{Section:Problem}
Videos combined with quizzes and polls are often for educational purposes in many applications including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and university lectures. For the authors of this resources this often involves splitting videos up into sections with a poll/quiz after each section to gauge understanding. It would be useful if quizzes could be saved and included directly into the videos so that analytics can be used to make discoveries about how best to present information to viewers so that they can take the most in.

\section{Goals and Scope} 
\label{Section:Goals and Scope}
This project will be split into three main sections:
\begin{description}[%
  before={\setcounter{descriptcount}{0}},%
  ,font=\bfseries\stepcounter{descriptcount}\thedescriptcount~]
\item[Quiz Authoring Tool] \hfill \\
The authoring tool will allow users to specify questions and polls to appear in the video and where these should be located. A JSON file will be exported that contains all of this data. The application will be designed with accessibility in mind.
\item[Overlaid Video Player] \hfill \\
A library will be implemented which allows quizzes and polls to be overlaid on Web videos, playable in the main browsers (Firefox, IE and Chrome) on different platforms (PC, Mac and Android). These videos could be any of the main video formats (MP4, WebM, OGG). The JSON files specifying the questions will be interpreted by the library and shown in the overlay. Accessibility considerations for the overlaid videos will be investigated.
\item[Video and Quiz Analytics] \hfill \\
Metrics of user behaviour will be recorded and methods of displaying these to the author will be explored.
